# Performance Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of our recent performance audit on the application. We identified several areas for improvement that could significantly enhance the user experience and overall system efficiency.

## Key Findings

1. Slow page load times on mobile devices
2. Inefficient database queries causing delays in data retrieval
3. Large asset sizes impacting initial load times

## Recommendations

1. Implement lazy loading and code splitting to improve mobile performance
2. Optimize database queries and consider caching frequently accessed data
3. Compress and optimize assets, leverage browser caching

## Conclusion

By implementing these recommendations, we expect to see a notable improvement in the application's performance, particularly on mobile devices. This will lead to better user satisfaction and potentially higher conversion rates.
